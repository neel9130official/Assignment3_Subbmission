# Python Math Tasks

This repository contains two basic Python programs that demonstrate fundamental concepts such as loops, recursion, and using the math module for mathematical operations like square root, logarithm, and trigonometric functions.



Task 1: Factorial Function

 Description:
This Python program:
- Defines a function named `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a number using either a **loop** or **recursion**.
- Takes an input number, calculates its factorial, and returns the result.
- Calls the function with a **sample input** and prints the output.


 Task 2: Using Math Module for Calculations

 Description:
This Python program:
- Asks the user to input a number.
- Uses Python's built-in `math` module to compute:
  -  Square root
  -  Natural logarithm (base `e`)
  -  Sine of the number
